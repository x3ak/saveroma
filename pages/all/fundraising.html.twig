        One of the easiest way to donate is to use Generosity â€“ crowdfunding platform developed by
        Indiegogo, where we have launched our fundraising campaign. All you need to have is a valid
        bank card and e-mail address.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note that this platform is secured and all transfers can be made anonymous if desired.
    </p>
    <p>
        The steps are as following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>access the campaign on the website,</li>
        <li>indicate amount you want to donate (you may want to remove option to donate to Generosity, setting this to $0),</li>
        <li>use you bank card.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Generosity team transfers collected amount to our bank account every 3 weeks.</p>
